# Beginner's Guide to SQL

Welcome to the **Beginner's Guide to SQL**. This document is designed to help you take your first steps into the world of SQL databases. Here you'll find examples of basic functions that will enable you to manipulate and query data effectively.

## What is SQL?

SQL stands for **Structured Query Language**, a programming language designed for managing and manipulating relational databases. It is the de facto standard for querying and modifying data stored in relational database management systems (RDBMS).

## Basic Operations in SQL

The most fundamental operations in SQL are known as CRUD, which stands for **Create**, **Read**, **Update**, and **Delete**.

### SELECT

The `SELECT` statement is used to select data from a database. The data returned is stored in a result table.

```sql
-- Select all columns from a table
SELECT * FROM table_name;

-- Select specific columns from a table
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;

-- Select with a condition
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```

## INSERT
The `INSERT INTO` statement is used to insert new records into a table.

```sql
-- Insert into specific columns
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2) VALUES (value1, value2);

-- Insert into all columns
INSERT INTO table_name VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
```

## UPDATE
The `UPDATE` statement is used to modify existing records in a table.
```sql
-- Update specific records
UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1 WHERE condition;

-- Update multiple columns
UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2 WHERE condition;
```
## DELETE
The `DELETE` statement is used to delete existing records from a table.
```sql
-- Delete specific records
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;

-- Delete all records
DELETE FROM table_name;
```
## Conclusion
This has been a brief overview of the basic operations in SQL. With practice and time, youâ€™ll learn to perform more complex queries and handle databases with confidence.
