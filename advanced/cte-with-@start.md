This SQL function GetRankedSalesByEmployee takes two parameters: @startDate and @endDate, which define the date range for the sales records to be considered. It returns a table that includes the `EmployeeID`, `FirstName`, `LastName`, total sales amount as TotalAmount, and the sales rank of each employee.

The function uses two Common Table Expressions (`CTEs`):

`TotalSales`: Calculates the total sales amount for each employee within the given date range.
`RankedSales`: Joins the TotalSales CTE with the Employees table to get employee details and ranks them based on the total sales amount.
Finally, the function returns the ranked list of employees and their total sales amount. This function can be called in a SELECT statement to retrieve the desired data.

```sql 
CREATE FUNCTION GetRankedSalesByEmployee(@startDate DATE, @endDate DATE)
RETURNS TABLE
AS
RETURN (
    WITH TotalSales AS (
        SELECT 
            EmployeeID, 
            SUM(Amount) AS TotalAmount
        FROM 
            Sales
        WHERE 
            SaleDate BETWEEN @startDate AND @endDate
        GROUP BY 
            EmployeeID
    ),
    RankedSales AS (
        SELECT 
            E.EmployeeID, 
            E.FirstName, 
            E.LastName, 
            T.TotalAmount,
            RANK() OVER (ORDER BY T.TotalAmount DESC) AS Rank
        FROM 
            Employees E
        INNER JOIN 
            TotalSales T ON E.EmployeeID = T.EmployeeID
    )
    SELECT 
        EmployeeID, 
        FirstName, 
        LastName, 
        TotalAmount, 
        Rank
    FROM 
        RankedSales
)
```
