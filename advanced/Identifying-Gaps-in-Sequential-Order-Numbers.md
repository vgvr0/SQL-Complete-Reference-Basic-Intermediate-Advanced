This SQL code aims to identify gaps in sequential data from an orders table. First, it creates a temporary table called "Sequences" that holds the minimum and maximum order numbers from the orders table. Then, it selects the missing sequence numbers by adding 1 to the minimum order number. It uses the "NOT EXISTS" clause to check if the next order number after the minimum doesn't exist in the orders table. This approach helps identify any gaps in the sequence of order numbers in the orders table.

```sql
-- Create a temporary table to hold the sequence information
WITH Sequences AS (
  -- Select the minimum and maximum order numbers to define the range
  SELECT MIN(order_number) AS start_seq, MAX(order_number) AS end_seq
  FROM orders
)
-- Select the missing sequence numbers
SELECT start_seq + 1 AS missing_sequence
-- Check if there is no order number exists in the sequence
FROM Sequences
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  -- Check if the next order number exists in the orders table
  SELECT 1
  FROM orders o
  WHERE o.order_number = Sequences.start_seq + 1
)

```
